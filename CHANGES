v1.0.3
-------
- The installer has been broken into several independent scripts.
  This increases the flexibility and doesn't force people to use the
  partitioning scripts I provided before. Now if you just want to use
  some parts of these scripts, you can. Want to install just the bootloader?
  Want to just download your desired Gentoo/Funtoo flavor? Now you can.
- Added a few more helper functions, variables to make things easier
- Added the ability to pick the desired Gentoo/Funtoo flavor through a menu
- Application has been renamed to "Bliss Toolkit" to signify the switch from
  an "installer" to just a set of scripts.
- Main script files have been renamed to "toostrap", "toochroot", 
  "extlinux-install". The switch to a set of scripts idea and names were 
  inspired from Arch Linux.

v1.0.2
-------
- Fixed bug where bootloader wasn't installing because the extlinux dir
  wasn't being created.
- Improved output of after install suggestions
- Fixed bug where the boot drive wasn't being formatted

v1.0.1
-------
- Added extlinux bootloader support
- Added my kernel configuration so people can have starting point
- Added a default fstab to the installer
- Installer now copies the stage3 and portage .tar.xz files to the new install
