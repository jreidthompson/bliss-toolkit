2.2.0
-------
toostrap:
- New parameters were added (from the PrintUsage function):

    Format: toostrap -d <chroot dir>

    > -d - Chroot Directory
    > -c - Desired Choice [optional]
    > -p - Download and install latest Portage tree [optional]
    > -f - Files Directory [optional]
    > -h - This help message [optional]

- You can now have a central 'files' directory by using the '-f' flag
- Downloading portage into a new chroot is now optional. You must use the '-p' flag
  if you want the portage snapshot to be downloaded and installed. By default only the
  stage3 will be downloaded and installed.

extlinux-install:
- Included a default bootloader config for extlinux in the 'examples' dir. This also
  fixes a bug where the script was looking for a non-existent bootloader example config.

toochroot:
- Small cleanups

2.1.0
-------
- Fixed minor bug where the "portage-latest.xz" file would be attempted
  to be checked for a stale date even if the file didn't exist in the "files" dir.
- The application will now verify the checksums for both the stage and portage files
  to guarantee that they are not corrupted.

2.0.0
-------
- Major rewrite in Python 3 to critical components
- Clean ups throughout all the tools and updated documentation
- Relicensed to the Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Removed Funtoo related code paths
- Removed files and scripts that are no longer needed.

v1.0.6
-------
- Removes 'i' attribute from ldlinux.sys so the script can delete the old
  extlinux directory if it exists (when installing the bootloader again).
- Added a few more comments to some parts of the code for clarity
- Added a new 'extlinux.conf'
- Cleared up some of the documentation in the 'USAGE' file

v1.0.5
-------
- Changed the URL of Funtoo's 'portage-latest' to a new and working location.

v1.0.4
-------
- Fixed errors in mount/umount scripts
- All tests [ ] have been switched to bash double brackets [[ ]]

v1.0.3.1
-------
- Fixed a typo in the 'toochroot' file that wasn't finding variables.sh
- v1.0.3 also included the sysrescd kernel config with ALSA/Camera stuff
  enabled (I forgot to write it below.. but it's here now).

v1.0.3
-------
- The installer has been broken into several independent scripts.
  This increases the flexibility and doesn't force people to use the
  partitioning scripts I provided before. Now if you just want to use
  some parts of these scripts, you can. Want to install just the bootloader?
  Want to just download your desired Gentoo/Funtoo flavor? Now you can.
- Added a few more helper functions, variables to make things easier
- Added the ability to pick the desired Gentoo/Funtoo flavor through a menu
- Application has been renamed to "Bliss Toolkit" to signify the switch from
  an "installer" to just a set of scripts.
- Main script files have been renamed to "toostrap", "toochroot",
  "extlinux-install". The switch to a set of scripts idea and names were
  inspired from Arch Linux.

v1.0.2
-------
- Fixed bug where bootloader wasn't installing because the extlinux dir
  wasn't being created.
- Improved output of after install suggestions
- Fixed bug where the boot drive wasn't being formatted

v1.0.1
-------
- Added extlinux bootloader support
- Added my kernel configuration so people can have starting point
- Added a default fstab to the installer
- Installer now copies the stage3 and portage .tar.xz files to the new install
