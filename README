For Gentoo & Funtoo Linux

Distributed under the ISC license which can be found in the LICENSE file.

DISCLAIMER: Before running the script, please check the tasks/partitions.sh
file. You will be asked once if you want to format, if you say yes then it will
by default wipe /dev/sda.

This script installs Funtoo Linux (by default) on your computer.

It doesn't install a kernel but I've provides you with my personal minimal 
kernel config for version 3.5.0. You most likely will need to tailor it for
your environment. This is really the only 'major' thing you will need to do.

The steps the script performs are as follows:

1. Partitions your machine automatically. (tasks/partitions.sh)
2. Creates required directories which will be used to mount your partitions
3. Mounts all of your partitions
4. Downloads and Installs Funtoo (tasks/install_it.sh)
5. Copies required configuration files (like resolve.conf)
6. Install the extlinux bootloader (If you want)
7. chroots into the new environment

For more information/instructions check the USAGE file.
