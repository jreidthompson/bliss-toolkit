For Gentoo & Funtoo Linux

Distributed under the ISC license which can be found in the LICENSE file.

These are a set of scripts that facilitates installing Gentoo or Funtoo Linux
on your computer.

I've provided the default sysresccd kernel config with ALSA/Video stuff enabled.
(Not everything was enabled but Intel HD Audio was).

Included scripts:

1. 'beforemath' - Creates base directories (like home, boot, if you use)
2. 'toomount' - Mounts directories to PREFIX
3. 'toostrap' - Asks you which Gentoo/Funtoo stage you want, and it downloads
   it with the corresponding latest portage. It then extracts it into the
   target PREFIX declared in resources/variables.sh
4. 'aftermath' - Copies network config, kernel config, fstab, etc, to PREFIX
5. 'extlinux-install' - Installs the extlinux bootloader to the passed drive
6. 'toochroot' - Cleanly chroots into the PREFIX
7. 'tooumount' - Umounts directories in PREFIX

For more information/instructions check the USAGE file.
