DISCLAIMER: Before running the script, please check the tasks/partitions.sh
file. You will be asked once if you want to format, if you say yes then it will
by default wipe /dev/sda.

This script installs Funtoo Linux (by default) on your computer.

It doesn't install a kernel/bootloader though, it literally just
installs the stage3/portage and chroots you into the environment.

The steps the script performs are as follows:

1. Partitions your machine automatically. (tasks/partitions.sh)
2. Creates required directories which will be used to mount your partitions
3. Mounts all of your partitions
4. Downloads and Installs Funtoo (tasks/install_it.sh)
5. Copies required configuration files (like resolve.conf)
6. chroots into the new environment

For more information/instructions check the USAGE file.
