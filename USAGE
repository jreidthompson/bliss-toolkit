NOTE: The 'toomount', 'tooumount', 'beforemath', and 'aftermath' scripts
are optional. You can edit them and use them for your convenience and for
your specific setup.

# If you aren't using the convenience scripts (manual mounting)
1. Partition and mount your partitions
2. Edit the PREFIX variable in 'resources/variables.sh' and make it point
   to where you want to install Gentoo to.
3. Run the 'toostrap' script, select the flavor you want, and wait.
4. Run the 'aftermath' script to do post install stuff like copy network
   settings and save a copy of your stage3/portage .tar files that you
   downloaded.
5. Optional (only for gpt layout, you can modify script to mbr):
   If you want to install the extlinux bootloader, run the
   'extlinux-install' script.
6. Chroot into your new install by running 'toochroot'

# If you are using the convenience scripts (automatic mounting)
1. Partition your drive
2. Edit the PREFIX variable in 'resources/variables.sh' and make it point
   to where you want to install Gentoo to.
3. Edit the DEFAULT_DIRS variable and add the directories you would like
   the 'beforemath' script to create (before automatically mounting).
4. Run the 'beforemath' script
5. Edit the 'toomount' script and make changes appropriate to your partition
   layout. Then run the 'toomount' script.
3. Run the 'toostrap' script, select the flavor you want, and wait.
4. Run the 'aftermath' script to do post install stuff like copy network
   settings and save a copy of your stage3/portage .tar files that you
   downloaded.
5. Optional (only for gpt layout, you can modify script to mbr):
   If you want to install the extlinux bootloader, run the
   'extlinux-install' script.
6. Chroot into your new install by running 'toochroot'
7. After you are done you can exit the chroot environment and quickly
   unmount your partitions by editing and running the 'tooumount' script.

# More info
After that is set, just run 'toostrap' and select the flavor you want
from the menu. If you already know what you want, then just pass that
number via the cli.

Example: (These are the options the menu gives you)
    1. Gentoo [x86_64]
    2. Gentoo [~x86_64]

If you wanted to install Gentoo x64, you just do 'toostrap 1' and that's it.

After the script finishes downloading and extract the stage/portage files,
you should run 'aftermath' so that it copies your network settings and also
the stage/portage files and other configuration files to your system.

After that is complete you can chroot to your new system by typing 'toochroot'.

If you want to install the extlinux bootloader, run 'extlinux-install' before chrooting.
