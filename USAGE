First check and edit the partitions.sh file according to your specifications.
Once you are done with that, just run the install.sh file and that's it.

Just wait till it's done and you will be in the chroot environment ready to
continue set up.

The script also assumes you will be using the syslinux bootloader,
thus a EF02 partition will not be made. If you want to use GRUB,
just make another addition in the tasks/partitions.sh file and create the
EF02 partition.

DISCLAIMER: Before running the script, please check the tasks/partitions.sh 
file. You will be asked once if you want to format, if you say yes then it will
by default wipe /dev/sda.

The default partition layout this script performs is as follows:
(All of these values and partitions can be easily changed by editing
 the tasks/partitions.sh file)

GPT Layout

/dev/sda1        /boot        250M        8300 (Linux Filesystem)
/dev/sda2	 LVM          100%FREE    8E00 (Linux LVM)

Volume Group name defaults to: vg

/dev/vg/swap        swap          9G       
/dev/vg/root	    /root 	  10G
/dev/vg/portage     /usr/portage  10G
/dev/vg/var         /usr/var      15G
/dev/vg/src         /usr/src      10G
/dev/vg/home        /home         20G

All the partitions will be formatted ext4 (except for swap).
This can be changed by editing the FSTYPE variable in tasks/partitions.sh

You can pick which Funtoo you want (Stable or Current) by editing the URL
in the tasks/install_it.sh file. Just comment the URL that is by default,
and pick the URL you want from the list.

##### For Gentoo Users #####
If you want to use this script to install Gentoo, the only thing you need to do
is add another line in the tasks/install_it.sh file that points to the Gentoo
stage3 and Gentoo portage snapshot. Also edit the file name variables if needed.
